# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Fix the "Maximum update depth exceeded" error in the toast system that occurs after removing user registration restrictions from the catalog. The error is causing infinite re-renders in the toast component and preventing the catalog from functioning properly.

## Glossary

- **Toast System**: The notification system using Radix UI Toast primitives for user feedback
- **Catalog Page**: The main product browsing and ordering interface accessible to all users
- **Auth Context**: The authentication context managing user login state
- **Settings Context**: The application settings and data management context
- **Infinite Loop**: A condition where state updates trigger more state updates indefinitely

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user browsing the catalog, I want the toast notifications to work properly without causing application crashes, so that I can receive feedback about my actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the catalog page loads, THE Toast System SHALL render without causing infinite re-renders
2. WHEN a user performs an action that triggers a toast, THE Toast System SHALL display the notification once
3. WHEN multiple toasts are triggered, THE Toast System SHALL handle them without state conflicts
4. WHEN the page re-renders, THE Toast System SHALL maintain stable state without loops
5. THE Catalog Page SHALL function normally for both registered and unregistered users

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an unregistered user, I want to add products to cart and create orders without authentication errors, so that I can complete my purchase without registration barriers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an unregistered user adds products to cart, THE Catalog Page SHALL not trigger authentication-related toast loops
2. WHEN an unregistered user creates an order, THE Toast System SHALL provide appropriate feedback without errors
3. WHEN authentication state changes, THE Toast System SHALL not cause infinite re-renders
4. THE Catalog Page SHALL handle missing authentication gracefully without toast spam
5. WHERE user authentication is optional, THE Toast System SHALL work consistently

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify and fix the root cause of the toast infinite loop, so that the application remains stable after removing authentication restrictions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN useEffect hooks trigger state updates, THE Toast System SHALL not cause cascading re-renders
2. WHEN context values change, THE Toast System SHALL maintain referential stability
3. WHEN toast state updates occur, THE Toast System SHALL prevent circular dependencies
4. THE Settings Context SHALL not trigger unnecessary re-renders in toast components
5. THE Auth Context SHALL not cause toast-related infinite loops when user state changes
