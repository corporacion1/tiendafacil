# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an Automatic Store Assignment System that automatically sets the active store ID for administrative users upon login and redirects them to their corresponding store branch. The system ensures that users with administrative roles (excluding "su" and "user") are automatically assigned to their designated store context, while end users can freely browse different stores.

## Glossary

- **Automatic_Store_Assignment_System**: The system that automatically sets active store ID and redirects administrative users upon login
- **Active_Store_ID**: The currently selected store identifier that determines user access scope
- **User_Store_ID**: The store identifier assigned to a user account
- **Login_Store_Setter**: Component that automatically sets the active store ID during user authentication
- **Super_User**: User with role "su" who is not subject to automatic store assignment
- **End_User**: User with role "user" who can browse and purchase from different stores freely
- **Administrative_User**: User with any role other than "su" and "user" who gets automatically assigned to their store
- **Store_Redirect_Handler**: Component that handles redirection to the appropriate store branch
- **Store_Access_Validator**: Component that validates if a user can access a page based on their store assignment and active store ID

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an administrative user, I want my active store to be automatically set when I log in, so that I am immediately directed to my assigned store context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user with role other than "su" and "user" completes login, THE Login_Store_Setter SHALL automatically set the active store ID to match the user's assigned store ID
2. WHEN a user with role "su" completes login, THE Login_Store_Setter SHALL not automatically set any active store ID
3. WHEN a user with role "user" completes login, THE Login_Store_Setter SHALL not automatically set any active store ID
4. THE Login_Store_Setter SHALL persist the active store ID in the user session for administrative users
5. THE Login_Store_Setter SHALL handle cases where an administrative user has no assigned store ID by preventing login completion
6. WHEN the active store ID is set, THE Login_Store_Setter SHALL trigger the redirect process immediately

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an administrative user, I want to be automatically redirected to my store branch after login, so that I can start working in my designated store context immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the active store ID is set for an administrative user, THE Store_Redirect_Handler SHALL redirect the user to their store-specific dashboard or main page
2. THE Store_Redirect_Handler SHALL construct the redirect URL based on the user's assigned store ID
3. THE Store_Redirect_Handler SHALL not redirect super users or end users automatically
4. THE Store_Redirect_Handler SHALL handle redirect failures gracefully by showing an error message
5. THE Store_Redirect_Handler SHALL complete the redirect before rendering any other page content

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an end user, I want to freely browse and purchase from different stores, so that I am not restricted to a single store context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user with role "user" completes login, THE Automatic_Store_Assignment_System SHALL not set any active store ID automatically
2. THE Automatic_Store_Assignment_System SHALL allow end users to manually select different stores during their session
3. THE Automatic_Store_Assignment_System SHALL not redirect end users to any specific store after login
4. THE Automatic_Store_Assignment_System SHALL allow end users to switch between stores freely
5. THE Automatic_Store_Assignment_System SHALL maintain end user's store selection preferences during their session

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all pages except catalog to validate store access, so that users can only access data from stores they are authorized to view.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to any page except catalog, THE Store_Access_Validator SHALL verify that the user's store ID matches the active store ID
2. WHEN a user with role "su" navigates to any page, THE Store_Access_Validator SHALL allow access without store validation
3. WHEN a user with role "user" navigates to catalog page, THE Store_Access_Validator SHALL allow access without store validation
4. IF the user's store ID does not match the active store ID, THEN THE Store_Access_Validator SHALL redirect to an unauthorized access page
5. THE Store_Access_Validator SHALL apply to all application routes except catalog page and authentication pages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the automatic store assignment to integrate with existing authentication, so that it works seamlessly with the current login flow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Automatic_Store_Assignment_System SHALL integrate with the existing user authentication system
2. THE Automatic_Store_Assignment_System SHALL access user role and store assignment from the current user data structure
3. THE Automatic_Store_Assignment_System SHALL work with existing session management
4. THE Automatic_Store_Assignment_System SHALL not interfere with existing authentication flows for super users and end users
5. THE Automatic_Store_Assignment_System SHALL execute after successful authentication but before final login completion for administrative users only
