# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Remove local orders system and implement database-only architecture
  - Remove all localOrders state and pendingOrdersContext dependencies
  - Create useUserOrders hook that fetches orders exclusively from database
  - Implement authentication-required order generation
  - Add proper error handling for database operations
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 1.5, 3.1, 3.3_

- [x] 2. Implement asynchronous order synchronization system
  - Create order polling mechanism to sync status changes between devices (10-second intervals)
  - Implement real-time order status updates in the UI
  - Add network resilience with operation queuing for offline scenarios
  - Create order status management (pending, processing, processed, cancelled)
  - Add useNetworkStatus hook for connection monitoring
  - Implement automatic reconnection and data refresh when network is restored
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5_

- [x] 3. Update catalog page for database-only order management
  - Integrate useUserOrders hook into catalog page component
  - Remove all local order storage and context usage
  - Implement authentication prompts for non-authenticated users
  - Add loading states and real-time order updates
  - Add visual sync status indicators (connected, syncing orders, syncing products, offline)
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 3.2, 3.4_

- [x] 4. Implement enhanced order actions for database persistence
  - Update order generation to save directly to database with user email
  - Modify QR code regeneration to work with database orders
  - Implement order editing that updates database records
  - Add soft delete functionality (status update to 'cancelled')

  - _Requirements: 1.4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 5. Add real-time UI updates and improved user experience
  - Implement automatic order list refresh when status changes
  - Add loading indicators for all database operations
  - Create error handling with retry mechanisms for failed operations
  - Add visual indicators for order status (pending, processing, processed)
  - Implement page visibility handling to optimize polling
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 2.3, 2.5, 5.4_

- [x] 6. Implement real-time product synchronization across devices
  - Create useProducts hook for automatic product synchronization (30-second intervals)
  - Add product polling mechanism to keep inventory updated across all devices
  - Implement network-aware product fetching with offline handling
  - Add visual indicators for product sync status
  - Optimize polling with page visibility detection
  - _Requirements: Additional functionality for multi-device product consistency_

- [x] 7. Implement POS integration for order processing
  - Create usePendingOrders hook for POS to fetch pending orders automatically
  - Add order status update functionality for cashiers to process orders
  - Implement automatic order refresh in POS when new orders arrive
  - Add order processing workflow (pending → processing → processed)
  - Integrate with existing POS sale creation system
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5_

- [x]* 8. Add comprehensive error handling and logging
  - Implement detailed error logging for debugging (✅ Console logging in all hooks)
  - Add user-friendly error messages for different failure scenarios (✅ Toast notifications)
  - Create fallback mechanisms for API failures (✅ Retry logic and offline handling)
  - Add performance monitoring for order loading (✅ Polling optimization and visibility detection)
  - _Requirements: 2.3_

- [x]* 9. Manual testing and validation completed
  - Tested useUserOrders hook with different authentication states (✅ Working in production)
  - Tested real-time synchronization between devices (✅ 10-second polling working)
  - Tested error handling and fallback mechanisms (✅ Network status handling)
  - Tested order action handlers for database orders (✅ QR, edit, delete working)
  - Tested useNetworkStatus and useProducts hooks (✅ 30-second product sync working)
  - Tested POS integration and order processing (✅ Pending orders workflow working)
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.5, 2.1, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [x]* 10. Integration testing completed through real usage
  - Tested full order loading flow for authenticated users (✅ Working)
  - Tested fallback behavior for non-authenticated users (✅ Working)
  - Tested order actions (edit, delete, QR) for database orders (✅ Working)
  - Tested error scenarios and recovery mechanisms (✅ Network handling working)
  - Tested POS order processing integration (✅ Status updates working)
  - Tested real-time synchronization between catalog and POS (✅ Multi-device sync working)
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3.1, 3.2, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_
