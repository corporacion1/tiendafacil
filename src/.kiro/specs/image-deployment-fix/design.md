# Design Document

## Overview

This design addresses the deployment-specific issue where multiple product images display correctly in local development but fail to cycle properly in the production catalog page, while working correctly in the inventory page across both environments. The solution focuses on identifying and fixing the root cause of this environment-specific behavior.

## Architecture

### Problem Analysis

Based on the code review, the issue appears to be related to:

1. **Environment-specific image URL generation**: The `getDisplayImageUrl` function may behave differently in production
2. **Image data consistency**: The product image data structure may not be consistent between environments
3. **Component-specific rendering**: The `CatalogProductCard` component may have different behavior than inventory components
4. **Image loading timing**: Production environment may have different image loading characteristics

### Root Cause Investigation

The primary suspects for the deployment issue are:

1. **Image URL Resolution**: Production may have different base URLs or CDN configurations
2. **Data Fetching**: Product data may be incomplete or malformed in production
3. **Component State Management**: Image cycling state may not be properly initialized in production
4. **Network Timing**: Production image loading may be slower, affecting the cycling logic

## Components and Interfaces

### 1. Image URL Debugging System

```typescript
interface ImageDebugInfo {
  productId: string;
  productName: string;
  environment: 'local' | 'production';
  imageCount: number;
  primaryImageUrl: string | undefined;
  allImageUrls: string[];
  displayUrls: string[];
  hasMultipleImages: boolean;
  errors: string[];
}
```

### 2. Enhanced CatalogProductCard

The component will be enhanced with:
- Comprehensive error logging
- Image loading state tracking
- Environment detection
- Fallback mechanisms

### 3. Image Validation Service

```typescript
interface ImageValidationService {
  validateImageUrls(product: Product): Promise<ImageValidationResult>;
  checkImageAccessibility(url: string): Promise<boolean>;
  generateDebugReport(product: Product): ImageDebugInfo;
}
```

## Data Models

### Enhanced Product Image Tracking

```typescript
interface ProductImageState {
  product: Product;
  currentImageIndex: number;
  isHovering: boolean;
  imageLoadStates: Record<string, 'loading' | 'loaded' | 'error'>;
  debugInfo: ImageDebugInfo;
}
```

## Error Handling

### 1. Image Loading Error Recovery

- Implement retry logic for failed image loads
- Provide fallback to single image display if multiple images fail
- Log detailed error information for debugging

### 2. Environment-Specific Configuration

- Detect production vs local environment
- Apply appropriate image URL transformations
- Handle CDN-specific requirements

### 3. Graceful Degradation

- Fall back to single image display if cycling fails
- Maintain basic product display functionality
- Preserve user experience even with image issues

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Environment Comparison Testing

- Compare image data structure between local and production
- Validate image URL accessibility in both environments
- Test image cycling functionality across environments

### 2. Network Condition Testing

- Test with slow network conditions
- Validate image loading under production-like latency
- Ensure cycling works with delayed image loads

### 3. Component Integration Testing

- Compare CatalogProductCard behavior with inventory components
- Validate consistent image utility function behavior
- Test ProductImageGallery integration

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Diagnostic Implementation

1. Add comprehensive logging to image utility functions
2. Implement environment detection
3. Create image validation service
4. Add debug information to CatalogProductCard

### Phase 2: Issue Resolution

1. Fix identified URL generation issues
2. Implement proper error handling
3. Add retry mechanisms for failed image loads
4. Ensure consistent behavior across components

### Phase 3: Validation and Monitoring

1. Deploy fixes to production
2. Monitor image loading performance
3. Validate cycling functionality
4. Implement ongoing monitoring

## Technical Considerations

### Image URL Generation

The `getDisplayImageUrl` function needs to be consistent across environments:
- Handle production CDN URLs correctly
- Maintain compatibility with Supabase storage
- Provide proper fallbacks for missing images

### Component State Management

The CatalogProductCard component needs robust state management:
- Proper initialization of image cycling state
- Handling of async image loading
- Consistent behavior across different network conditions

### Performance Optimization

- Preload images for smooth cycling
- Implement efficient image caching
- Minimize network requests in production

## Monitoring and Observability

### Image Loading Metrics

- Track image load success rates
- Monitor cycling functionality usage
- Measure performance differences between environments

### Error Reporting

- Comprehensive error logging for image issues
- Environment-specific error tracking
- User experience impact monitoring
