# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the critical issue where multiple product images display correctly in the local development environment but fail to render properly in the production deployment environment. Specifically, the catalog page shows only single images in production while the inventory page correctly displays multiple images in both environments. This inconsistency affects the customer catalog experience and product presentation.

## Glossary

- **Catalog_Page**: The customer-facing product catalog where images are not displaying correctly in production
- **Inventory_Page**: The admin inventory management page where images display correctly in all environments
- **Local_Environment**: The development environment where all images display correctly
- **Production_Environment**: The deployed environment where catalog images fail to display multiple images
- **Image_Display_System**: The complete system responsible for storing, retrieving, and displaying product images
- **ProductImageGallery**: The React component responsible for displaying multiple product images
- **CatalogProductCard**: The component that displays products in the catalog with image cycling functionality

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a customer browsing the catalog, I want to see all product images with the same cycling functionality in production as I see in local development, so that I can view all available product images.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a customer hovers over a product in the catalog in production, THE CatalogProductCard SHALL cycle through all available product images as it does in local environment
2. WHEN multiple images exist for a product, THE CatalogProductCard SHALL display the image counter badge showing "X/Y" format in production
3. THE CatalogProductCard SHALL maintain the same auto-cycling behavior on hover in production as in local development
4. WHEN a customer clicks on a product image, THE ProductImageGallery SHALL display all available images in the modal in production

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify why the catalog image cycling works locally but not in production, so that I can fix the deployment-specific issue.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Image_Display_System SHALL provide consistent image data structure between local and production environments
2. WHEN debugging image issues, THE CatalogProductCard SHALL log image loading errors and data inconsistencies
3. THE getAllProductImages function SHALL return the same image array structure in both environments
4. THE hasMultipleImages function SHALL return consistent boolean values for the same products across environments

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a store administrator, I want the catalog to display product images consistently with the inventory page, so that customers see the same image quality and functionality as administrators.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN comparing catalog and inventory pages in production, THE Image_Display_System SHALL show the same number of images for each product
2. THE image URL generation SHALL work consistently between CatalogProductCard and inventory ProductRow components
3. THE getDisplayImageUrl function SHALL return valid URLs for all product images in production
4. WHEN products have multiple images, THE catalog SHALL display them with the same reliability as the inventory page
