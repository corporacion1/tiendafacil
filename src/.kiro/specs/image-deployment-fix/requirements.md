# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the critical issue where multiple product images display correctly in the local development environment but fail to render properly in the production deployment environment. This deployment-specific image rendering problem affects user experience and product catalog functionality.

## Glossary

- **Image_Display_System**: The complete system responsible for storing, retrieving, and displaying product images
- **Local_Environment**: The development environment where images display correctly
- **Production_Environment**: The deployed environment where images fail to display
- **Image_Storage_Service**: The service (likely Supabase) used to store and serve product images
- **Image_URL_Generator**: The component that generates URLs for accessing stored images
- **Image_Component**: React components responsible for rendering product images in the UI

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a customer browsing the catalog, I want to see all product images correctly in the deployed application, so that I can make informed purchasing decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the catalog in production, THE Image_Display_System SHALL render all product images with the same quality and completeness as in the local environment
2. WHEN multiple images exist for a product, THE Image_Display_System SHALL display all images without missing or broken image placeholders
3. IF an image fails to load, THEN THE Image_Display_System SHALL provide appropriate fallback handling and error messaging
4. THE Image_Display_System SHALL maintain consistent image loading performance between local and production environments

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a store administrator, I want the image upload and display functionality to work reliably across all environments, so that I can manage product catalogs effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator uploads multiple images in production, THE Image_Storage_Service SHALL store and serve all images correctly
2. THE Image_URL_Generator SHALL produce valid, accessible URLs for all stored images in production
3. WHEN images are uploaded through the admin interface, THE Image_Display_System SHALL immediately reflect the changes in both admin and customer views
4. THE Image_Storage_Service SHALL maintain data consistency between local and production image storage

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify and resolve the root cause of the deployment image issue, so that the system works reliably in all environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Image_Display_System SHALL implement proper environment-specific configuration for image storage and retrieval
2. WHEN debugging image issues, THE Image_Display_System SHALL provide clear error logging and diagnostic information
3. THE Image_URL_Generator SHALL handle environment-specific base URLs and authentication correctly
4. THE Image_Component SHALL implement proper error boundaries and loading states for production resilience
